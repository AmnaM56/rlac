## Introduction: Violence in Harry Potter, & Why Should It Be Studied? 

The Harry Potter series, by J.K Rowling, is built around violence; duels, wars, curses and death shape both the original novels as well as the vast landscape of over a million fanfictions they inspired. Yet while readers often assume fanfiction simply imitates Rowling’s style, authors of fanfiction frequently reimagine tone, pacing, and emotional intensity. This project asks: How does the use of explicit violent language differ between Rowling’s novels and Harry Potter fanfiction, and what does this suggest about how each text portrays conflict?

In order to investigate this question, we analyzed two novels by J.K Rowling (Goblet of Fire and Deathly Hallows), in comparison to three fanfiction texts. Two computational text analysis softwares were used for this analysis: Mhara conducted an analysis in Voyant tools, Amna conducted an analysis in R (Posit Cloud), and a cross-examination of the results from both software was discussed in order to gain a wider, more in-depth understanding. Using these two analysis softwares, we examined patterns in violent vocabulary across approximately one million words of text in total. Rather than relying on selective close reading, we use distant reading to identify broader linguistic patterns that shape how violence is represented.
